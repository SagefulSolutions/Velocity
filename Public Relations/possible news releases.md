### "Internet so fast it can be compared to catching lightning in a bottle!"

Weston city council has voted! It turns out the city will be connecting it's departments and then allowing others to tap into that fiber footprint for a set fee of $4,500. This is available to anybody that sits along the fiber pathway. The way it will work is the amount can be paid upfront with cheaper monthly costs associated with the service, or they can spread out payments over a TWENTY YEAR period @ 3% interest by paying the city more per month.

### "Lewis County should be called "Lightning County"
	
With their new internet, Lewis County just put West Virginia on the map in the technology world. Located dead center of the state, it serves as a perfect geographic location to start branching out to other areas within the state. 
	
It's built on an open network principal, this means you pay between $25 and $75 per month and have total and complete control over your internet because you are plugged straight into the backbone. No modems or anything to be able to access the network but your piece of fiber and your own (or leased) router.
	
People are finding that they can connect amongst each other at the full 1 Gbps for file sharing, spreadsheets between home and office, and more importantly ANY application that will work via Local Area Network technology, will run over this network. That means web servers and INSTANT page load times. It means if you want to share that HD or Ultra-HD video with grandma a few houses down, you can, and it will be instant, not take minutes or HOURS to download.	

Did we mention there is no limit to the amount of bandwidth you share amongst the fiber footprint and never will be?! That's right! Anybody inside this footprint has total 100% access to the fiber that runs from their home (the edge or FTTH) to the fiber-lit cabinet at the corner included in their payment of their piece of fiber.
		
### "L.C. is L.I.T.!"

After running over 10 miles of fiber optic cables to move data at the speed of light, the first fiber path has been lit. This is a HUGE milestone in the project's goal of interconnecting every address in the city and county to this system.


### Bridgeport is the state's very first Gigabit city. Philippi is the first gigabit town. Snowshoe is the first gigabit resort in the state. All these places now have access to 1000Mbps download speeds as well as upload. For a reasonable price!!

A four-way cooperation between a newly founded Internet Users Association Cooperative ("IUA" or "IUA Co-op"), Lewis County Commission, Harrison County Commission and Citynet could help us get a 1.5Gbps backhaul connecting Harrison County and Lewis County to Citynet's fiber loop in the Stonewood area.

Check out what Citynet is offering (https://www.internethog.com/), and what we are missing. It would take around $7,500, each, in shared-equipment investment from the four parties to have both counties connected with unlicensed 24GHz microwave backhauls.

These backhauls would have enough bandwidth to let every home have no less than 10Mbps/10Mbps (reliably, not UP TO, like you REALLY GET 10/10 Mbps dedicated to the router sitting at your end. Many people will be able to use this internet simultaneously and without noticing slow downs from others "over crowding" the connection, as happens so often with ISPs around Lewis County. Also, with better upload speeds than ANY ISP in the area, comes the ability to get what you create out of your house and to the world many many times faster! Think of a 1080 or 4k video that you want to upload to YouTube, VIMEO, or Facebook taking you two hours and eight minutes to upload or FOUR MINUTES to upload if we could make this happen. ;)

If you are interested in making this project a reality, please reach out to us and get involved. I'd like to gauge the interest and try to get together a group of people that are sick of this internet fiasco, so that we can discuss and make things better.

We also have a GitHub repository dedicated to this project that I started a few years ago.
