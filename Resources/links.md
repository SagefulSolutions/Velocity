Notes:

Internet Users Association Cooperative (IUA or IUAC)
  - Internet comes from Bridgeport/Stonewood Citynet Fiber loop via 1.5+ Gbps uplinks (192 GBps/196,608MBps) 
      -(1.5*1024/8*1024)/3950
  - All users own the network based on the level of service they subscribe to. (Percentages per package will need to be fleshed out)
